## Usage

Using Sqids Apex is straightforward. After installing, you can generate short unique IDs with just a few lines of code. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```apex
Integer number = 123456789;
String shortId = Sqids.generateShortId(number);
System.debug(shortId);
```

This will output a short unique ID corresponding to the input number.

## Examples

Here are some practical examples to illustrate how to use Sqids Apex effectively:

### Example 1: Generating Short IDs

```apex
for (Integer i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    String shortId = Sqids.generateShortId(i);
    System.debug('Short ID for ' + i + ': ' + shortId);
}
```

### Example 2: Using Short IDs in URLs

You can use the generated short IDs in URLs to create user-friendly links. For instance:

```apex
String baseUrl = 'https://example.com/item/';
for (Integer i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    String shortId = Sqids.generateShortId(i);
    String url = baseUrl + shortId;
    System.debug('URL for item ' + i + ': ' + url);
}
```
